Description: This package is designed to demonstrate how basic features of text
  analysis can be utilized to analyze and represent a text file or string while 
  applying a humorous lens (because what is data science without a dash of 
  humor!). It counts the number of words from a text, calculates the average word
  length of that text, and returns an animal image corresponding to the average
  word length. It subsequently transforming the text into a wordcloud in the 
  shape of the animal. We have included a bonus fourth function for fun, inspired 
  by the popular childhood game - MadLibs.
