Description: This package is designed to demonstrate how basic features of text
analysis can be utilized to analyze and represent a text file or string while 
applying a humorous lens (because what is data science without a dash of 
humor!). It counts the number of words from a text, calculates the average word
length of that text, and returns an animal image corresponding to the average
word length. It subsequently transforming the text into a wordcloud in the 
shape of the animal. We have included a bonus fourth function for fun, inspired 
by the popular childhood game - MadLibs.
